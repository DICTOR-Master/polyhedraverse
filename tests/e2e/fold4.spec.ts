/**
 * The 4D fold's "Attach via 4D fold…" entry point was removed (direct
 * user decision, 2026-09-11): the underlying math is exact for a single
 * attached pair, but has a real, unsolved limitation once 3+ copies
 * share an edge, and duoprism.ts's own construction now offers an
 * always-exact way to build groups instead. This file checks the entry
 * point is genuinely gone, and that the underlying load/scrub machinery
 * (kept intentionally, so an already-saved assembly with a real fold4
 * connection isn't silently broken) still works when reached directly
 * through localStorage rather than the removed button.
