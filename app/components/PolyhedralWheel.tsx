/**
 * PolyhedralWheel — a dodecahedron-shaped 3D radial menu for picking a
 * starting shape, replacing the flat "Start over with" button row (which
 * doesn't scale: 29 shapes today, headed toward 100+ once the Johnson
 * family fills in). Ported from Rhombiverse's Rhombic Wheel 3D
 * (`src/app/rhombic-wheel-3d.js`/`-core.js`) — same interaction MECHANICS
 * (per-face labels, drag-vs-click disambiguation, hover/hold-to-reveal
 * text, the `rgba(2,2,6,0.55)` backdrop / `rgba(10,12,20,0.85)` panel
 * opacities) — but a regular dodecahedron instead of a rhombic
 * dodecahedron (the user's own call: 12 faces either way, but "may have
 * less empty space" for Polyhedraverse's use case than a 20-face
 * icosahedron would), and its OWN color identity rather than
 * Rhombiverse's cyan/gold, per direct user request: a metallic silver
 * mesh (`HUD_METAL`) for the wheel object itself, green script/UI
 * (`SCRIPT_COLOR`) for labels and panel chrome. The small always-visible
 * corner HUD element Rhombiverse also has (`hud-wheel-3d.js`) is still
 * out of scope for this pass (see the docstring below) — when it's
 * built, it's silver with black script, not gold, per that same
 * follow-up direction.
 *
 * Scope note: this first pass is the wheel SHELL plus the SHAPE PICKER
 * only (family-grouped: Deltahedra/Platonic/Archimedean/Johnson/Catalan/
 * Prisms/Antiprisms -- 7 families since Prisms and Antiprisms split into
 * two independently browsable families, see app/lib/polyhedra/families.ts),
 * per explicit user direction to build that before folding in actions
 * (augment/diminish), view modes (Spherical/X-Ray), or the corner HUD
 * element above. 7 families fit comfortably within the dodecahedron's 12
 * faces at the family-selection level -- all 12 filled, no spares, via
 * antipodal clones/dual-pairings plus a "Full Catalog" entry (see
 * `resolveSlots`'s `level.kind === 'families'` branch and its own
 * comment for the exact face layout).
 * `FAMILIES` still maps to face slots with no change needed as families are
 * added.
 *
 * Geometry: reuses this registry's own POLYHEDRA.DODECAHEDRON spec
 * directly (vertices + faces already unit-edge, already validated) —
 * never a second hand-declared dodecahedron, same "derive, don't
 * duplicate" rule every other file in app/lib/polyhedra/ already follows.

 * Per-symbol scale + pixel offset so every glyph reads as the same size

 * found live, in order:
 *
 * 1. SIZE: different glyphs -- the geometric family symbols, and
 *    individual shapes' own single-letter symbols (id.slice(0,1)) --
 *    occupy very different actual ink area at an identical font-size (a
 *    thin "I" vs a wide "M", a small ★ vs a filled ⬢). `scale` (below)
 *    corrects this, toward a capital "M"'s own measured size as a
 *    reference (representative of the per-shape letter symbols, which
 *    need the least correction).
 *
 * 2. CENTERING: fixing (1) alone still left the pentagon/diamond/hexagon
 *    family symbols visibly off-center within their badge -- a *.pw-
 *    label-glyph is centered by its PARENT's flexbox, which centers the
 *    glyph's own CSS LAYOUT box (line-height:1 -> the FONT's generic
 *    ascent+descent, IDENTICAL for every character), not that specific
 *    glyph's actual rendered ink. A geometric shape glyph's ink commonly
 *    sits at a different vertical offset within its em-box than a plain
 *    uppercase letter's does, so the same box-centering leaves the INK
 *    itself looking uncentered. `dx`/`dy` correct for exactly that gap
 *    -- computed once, geometrically, from the SAME Canvas2D measurement
 *    already needed for (1) (`fontBoundingBoxAscent/Descent`, the
 *    generic per-font metrics driving line-height:1 layout, vs
 *    `actualBoundingBoxAscent/Descent`, THIS glyph's real ink extent),
 *    not eyeballed per-symbol.
 *
 * Applied together as `transform: translate(dx,dy) scale(k)` -- CSS
 * composes transform-list functions in listed order (the LAST one
 * transforms the point first), so scale happens first (about the
 * glyph's own center, growing/shrinking it in place) and translate then
 * shifts the result by a FIXED dx/dy in real pixels, unaffected by k.

           found live: different glyphs (the geometric family symbols
           △⬠⬡⬢▭▬★◇, and individual shapes' own single-letter symbols,
           e.g. "T"/"J"/"I"/"W") occupy very different actual ink area at
           an identical font-size, so faces read as noticeably different
           sizes even though nothing was numerically different. Giving
           every symbol the same fixed circular badge -- diameter fixed,
           glyph centered inside via flex -- makes the WHEEL FACE ITSELF
           a consistent size regardless of which glyph happens to be
           inside it, which is what actually reads as "consistent size"
           at a glance (a thin ring, not a pentagon: a circle doesn't
           visually compete with any of the family symbols' own polygon
           shapes the way another polygon frame would). */
