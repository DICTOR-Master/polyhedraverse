/**
 * Whether two faces are true geometric matches for face-attach — same
 * vertex count is NOT enough once irregular-faced families exist
 * (Catalan solids): a rhombic dodecahedron's rhombus (diagonal ratio
 * sqrt(2)) and a rhombic triacontahedron's rhombus (diagonal ratio phi)
 * are both 4-sided, but gluing one onto the other would not sit flush
 * — a genuinely different shape, not just a scale mismatch. Checks
 * whether face2's own edge-length AND interior-angle sequence (computed
 * the same way faceRotationalSymmetry does) matches face1's REVERSED
 * sequence under some cyclic rotation.
 *
 * **Why reversed, not direct — a real, two-part finding, not a
 * first-principles assumption.** The actual attach transform
 * (ShapeViewer.tsx / verify-face-attach.ts's computeFaceAttach) opposes
 * the two faces' outward normals (so incoming grows away from target,
 * not into it) and only ever computes a ROTATION, never a reflection.
 * A first version of this function checked the DIRECT (non-reversed)
 * sequence for exactly that reason — "the transform can't reflect, so
 * don't offer a match that would need one." That was half right: the
 * transform can't reflect, but normal-opposition itself means the
 * physical relationship between target and incoming, as seen from a
 * single fixed external viewpoint, is inherently mirror-like — proven
 * directly (Catalan solids batch 2, DISDYAKIS_TRIACONTAHEDRON): every
 * face here is a scalene triangle with NO reflective symmetry of its
 * own (genuinely chiral as a 2D shape), and attaching a copy of the
 * solid to ANOTHER INSTANCE of the identical face (same winding, same
 * handedness — what the old direct check would approve) was checked
 * by brute-force search over every possible twist angle and found to
 * have NO solution closer than 0.33 units of error. Attaching that
 * same face to its actual geometric mirror partner elsewhere on the
 * solid (found by matching reversed edge-length order at the vertex-0
 * role), using the exact same unmodified transform, coincides to
 * within 1e-16 (floating-point noise). For every REGULAR or
 * achiral-with-a-reflective-symmetry face already in this registry
 * (squares, rhombi, isosceles triangles, kites — everything through
 * Catalan batch 1), a face's reversed sequence is ALWAYS reachable via
 * some rotation of its own direct sequence (that symmetry is exactly
 * what "achiral" means here), so switching from direct to reversed
 * matching changes nothing for any of them — confirmed by the full
 * registry's own `verify:face-attach` staying at 0 failures across
 * every prior family. It only changes behavior — correctly — once a
 * genuinely chiral 2D face shape (no reflective symmetry at all, first
 * appearing with the scalene-triangle Catalan solids) exists.
