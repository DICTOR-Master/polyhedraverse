/**
 * Canonical family/facet data layer, shared by PolyhedralWheel and the

 * UIs can never disagree about family membership, labels, or symbols.
 *
 * A shape's family isn't always singular. The registry's own comments say
 * so directly: platonic.ts skips the tetrahedron/octahedron/icosahedron
 * because "they're D4/D8/D20 in ./deltahedra.ts" (they ARE Platonic
 * solids, just not re-derived there), and prisms.ts skips the 4-gonal
 * prism and 3-gonal antiprism because those ARE the cube and the
 * octahedron. So a shape can carry more than one family tag -- encoded
 * below as an explicit, documented overlap patch (EXTRA_MEMBERSHIP)
 * layered on top of the registry's own per-family id arrays, never
 * guessed at runtime.

// Revised for real distinctiveness, not picked freehand: every symbol
// has its own base SHAPE (triangle/pentagon/hexagon/diamond/rectangle),
// no two sharing one the way Catalan's old small-diamond (⬦) and
// Platonic's own diamond (◇) once did. Outline-vs-filled is used
// deliberately, not decoratively, for the two families with a genuine
// real-world relationship: Archimedean/Catalan (true polar duals -- see
// this level's own comment in PolyhedralWheel.tsx) share the hexagon
// outline/fill pair, and Prisms/Antiprisms (a natural paired
// construction family, though not strict duals of each other) share
// the rectangle outline/fill pair -- so the symbol choice itself
// reinforces which families are related, not just avoids collisions.
// PLATONIC is a pentagon (⬠) as a direct count mnemonic -- there are
// exactly five Platonic solids. JOHNSON took over the diamond (◇) that
// pentagon displaced (Johnson has no dual/pairing relationship to
// encode, so any distinct outline shape works). ★ is deliberately
