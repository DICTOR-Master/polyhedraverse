/**
 * 4D Radial Cell Projection — Stage 1's generic engine: a 3D seed cell +
 * a real 4D adjacency rule (hyperplane rotation, not a per-pair 3D
 * rigid-transform patch) + a 4D->3D perspective projection = a genuine
 * 3D representation of a regular 4-polytope. One engine, parameterized
 * per seed shape, not four hardcoded objects.
 *
 * This supersedes the earlier fold4.ts approach for the *general*
 * multi-sibling case: fold4 tried to reconcile per-pair 3D rigid
 * corrections after the fact, which don't compose associatively (see
 * this session's own fold4 investigation — confirmed oscillation for
 * any node with 2+ simultaneous edge-partners). This engine instead
 * builds real 4D coordinates from the start via hyperplane rotations —
 * the literal Wythoff/Coxeter construction used to generate every
 * regular 4-polytope. Rotations in a finite reflection group compose
 * exactly and the orbit is *guaranteed* to close after finitely many
 * steps; there is no iterative numerical correction to oscillate.
 *
 * theta (the cell-to-cell 4D dihedral angle) is NOT derivable from a
 * cell's own 3D dihedral angle by any simple formula — checked
 * directly: the tesseract's own angle-defect (90deg, from fourD.ts's
 * closureClass at k=3) happens to equal its theta (90deg), but the
 * 16-cell's defect (77.9deg, at k=4) does NOT equal its theta (60deg).
 * So FOUR_D_SHAPE_PARAMS below is not a shortcut for something already
 * computed elsewhere — each entry is an independently required,
 * independently verified fact about that specific target 4-polytope's
 * real embedded geometry. Derivation for each (see
 * scripts/verify-radial-projection.ts for the full checks):
 *  - tesseract: the [-1,1]^4 hypercube's 8 facet hyperplanes.
 *  - 16-cell: the +-e_i (i=1..4) cross-polytope's 16 signed-orthant cells.
 *  - 24-cell: rectifying the 16-cell (the cuboctahedron analogy one
 *    dimension up — cuboctahedron = rectified cube = rectified
 *    octahedron; 24-cell = rectified tesseract = rectified 16-cell).
 *  - 120-cell: duality with the 600-cell, whose 120 vertices are the
 *    binary icosahedral group's unit quaternions.

 * other closure, so the shell-build feature can treat all 6 verified
 * closures (docs/radial-cell-projection.md section 21) uniformly instead
 * of special-casing the 600-cell's own dualize()-based path.
 *
 * `shell` is computed fresh here via BFS over the dual's own adjacency
 * list from cell 0, mirroring `buildCellComplex`'s own BFS -- the dual
 * complex has no `transform`/`normal` chain to inherit it from, but the
 * same "ring distance from a fixed start cell" meaning applies.
 *
 * Every dual cell here is a regular tetrahedron (each 120-cell vertex
 * has degree exactly 4, so each dual cell has exactly 4 vertices) and
 * the tetrahedron seed's own face list (`POLYHEDRA.D4.faces`) already
 * contains all C(4,3)=4 possible 3-vertex subsets of a 4-point set --
 * so ANY assignment of a dual cell's 4 vertices to indices 0..3
 * produces the same combinatorial tetrahedron via that face list (at
 * worst a global winding/outward-normal flip, never a topological
 * defect). This is what makes reusing D4's own topology safe here
 * without first proving a specific vertex correspondence -- a concern
 * that would matter for a lower-symmetry seed, but not for a shape
 * whose face list is already "every possible face."
