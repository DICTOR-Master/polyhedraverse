/**
 * 4D extension: the real fold math for closing the geometric gap between
 * two same-shape SIBLING cells that are each independently face-attached
 * to two ADJACENT faces of a shared parent cell (the user's own worked
 * example: a dodecahedron with a second dodecahedron attached to each of
 * its 12 faces).
 *
 * Superseded design note (kept for anyone reading history/diffs): an
 * earlier version of this file scaled each folded cell's own geometry
 * toward its shared face with the parent, on the theory that "the stored
 * flush-3D pose already IS the true 4D pose, unmodified." That's true in
 * isolation for a single parent+child pair (two cells sharing one face
 * are always trivially flush, in any dimension) -- but it's the WRONG
 * quantity for what actually needs fixing: the relationship BETWEEN TWO
 * SIBLINGS sharing an edge of the same parent, which a lone-pair squish
 * never touches at all. Verified directly, not assumed: two real
 * DODECAHEDRON cells independently flush-attached to a shared parent's
 * two adjacent faces are genuinely ~10.3deg apart at their own far edge
 * (scripts/verify-fold4.ts) -- exactly Stage A's own k=3 `defectDeg` for
 * a dodecahedron, the real geometric fact this whole feature exists to
 * show. The fix below rotates each sibling toward the other, around
 * their shared edge, closing half the defect each -- the correct
 * geometric operation, not a per-node scale.
 *
 * The math: a polyhedron edge borders exactly 2 faces, so at most 2
 * independently fold4-attached siblings can ever share one parent edge --
 * meaning the relevant closure case in THIS app is always k=3 (the
 * parent itself is the 3rd cell around that edge), regardless of which
 * other k values a shape could theoretically also support (see
 * fourD.ts's own closureClass for those). `edgeClosingCorrection` returns
 * the rotation (around that shared edge, through its midpoint) that
 * closes HALF the k=3 defect for whichever cell sits on the first face
 * passed in; the mirror rotation for the OTHER cell is obtained by
 * calling it again with the two face indices swapped.
