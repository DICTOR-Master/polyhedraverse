/**
 * 4D extension, Stage A: classifies which registered 3D shapes can be a
 * "cell" of some convex 4-polytope, purely from their own already-stored
 * geometry (vertices/edges/faces) — never a hand-stored field on the
 * shape itself. Same "derive, don't duplicate" rule core.ts's own file
 * header states for every other derived fact in this registry.
 *
 * The math: a 3D polyhedron closes into a finite solid because the FACE
 * angles meeting at a shared VERTEX sum to less than 360° (the "angle
 * defect" that gives a polyhedron its curvature). The 4D analogue is one
 * dimension up: a 4-polytope closes because the DIHEDRAL angles of its
 * CELLS (3D shapes) meeting at a shared EDGE sum to less than 360° — the
 * natural angle measure at an edge in 3D is the dihedral angle between
 * its two bounding faces, exactly the way the natural angle measure at a
 * vertex in 2D/3D is an interior face angle. `k` copies of a cell meeting
 * at a shared edge need `k * dihedralAngle < 360°` to curve into a real
 * 4D closure; `=360°` tiles ordinary flat 3D space instead (the cube's
 * own case at k=4); `>360°` never closes at all (the icosahedron, at any
 * k — verified below, not assumed).
